- **File Transfer & Analysis**: Secure file upload/download between agents and central server
- **Screenshot Capture**: Remote system screenshot capabilities for incident response
- **Process Monitoring**: Real-time process tracking and analysis

### Technical Features
- **Flask Web Framework**: Modern Python web application with RESTful API
- **Material Dashboard UI**: Professional, responsive interface built with Bootstrap 5
- **Real-time Updates**: Live agent status monitoring and connection tracking
- **Secure Authentication**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Database Persistence**: SQLite with support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- **API-First Design**: Comprehensive REST API for integration and automation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components
- **Central Server**: Flask-based web application with threat intelligence engine
- **Monitoring Agents**: Lightweight Python agents for endpoint surveillance
- **Threat Intelligence Engine**: IP reputation checking and categorization
- **Web Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring interface with Material Design
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for agent communication and data retrieval

### Agent Capabilities
- System information gathering (OS, hardware, network)
- Network connection monitoring and analysis
- Process tracking and system resource monitoring
- File activity surveillance
- Screenshot capture and file transfer
- Heartbeat monitoring for agent health

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Redis (for Celery tasks)
- AbuseIPDB API key (optional, for threat intelligence)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Cybersecurity-Project-master
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export ABUSEIPDB_KEY="your-abuseipdb-key"  # Optional
   ```

4. **Initialize database**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Or build manually
docker build -t cybersecurity-platform .
docker run -p 5000:5000 cybersecurity-platform
```

## üì± Usage

### Web Dashboard
- Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`
- Monitor agent status and system health
- View threat intelligence reports
- Analyze network connections and process activities

### Agent Deployment
1. Copy `agent.py` to target systems
2. Configure server endpoint in agent configuration
3. Run agent with appropriate permissions
4. Monitor agent status in dashboard

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/agent/<id>` - Agent status and information
- `POST /api/agent/<id>/file` - File upload from agent
- `GET /api/agent/<id>/connections` - Network connection data
- `POST /api/agent/<id>/output` - Command output from agent

## üîß Configuration

### Server Configuration
- Database connection settings in `apps/config.py`
- Threat intelligence API keys via environment variables
- Agent communication endpoints and timeouts

### Agent Configuration
- Server base URL and API endpoints
- Heartbeat intervals and connection timeouts
- YARA rules path for malware scanning
- File transfer and monitoring paths

## üö® Security Features

- **IP Reputation Scoring**: Integration with AbuseIPDB for threat assessment
- **Connection Analysis**: Real-time network connection monitoring
- **Process Surveillance**: System process tracking and analysis
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: File transfer and analysis capabilities
- **Role-Based Access Control**: User authentication and authorization

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live agent status and system health
- **Threat Intelligence**: IP reputation and categorization
- **Connection Logs**: Network activity monitoring and analysis
- **System Metrics**: Process and resource utilization tracking
- **File Transfer Logs**: Secure file upload/download tracking

## üîç Threat Intelligence

The platform integrates with AbuseIPDB to provide:
